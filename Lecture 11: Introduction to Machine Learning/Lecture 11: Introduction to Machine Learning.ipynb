    "### Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Sensitivity, and Specificity: Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sensitivity\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "Sensitivity, also known as the true positive rate or recall, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:\n",
    "Sensitivity = True Positives (TP) / True Positives (TP) + False Negatives (FN)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "A high sensitivity means that the test is good at identifying positive cases. It’s particularly important in medical diagnostics where missing a condition can have severe consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Specificity\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "Specificity, also known as the true negative rate, measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified by the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:\n",
    "Specificity = True Negatives (TN)/True Negatives (TN) + False Positives (FP)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "A high specificity means that the test is good at identifying negative cases. It’s crucial in situations where a false positive can lead to unnecessary stress or treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Positive Predictive Value (PPV)\n",
    "**Definition**:\n",
    "Positive Predictive Value, also known as precision, measures the proportion of positive results in a test that are true positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**:\n",
    "PPV = True Positives (TP) True Positives (TP) + False Positives (FP)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**:\n",
    "PPV is a measure of the accuracy of the positive test results. A high PPV indicates that a positive test result is likely to represent a true positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario\n",
    "Consider a diagnostic test for a disease:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **True Positives (TP)**: Number of individuals correctly identified as having the disease.\n",
    "- **False Negatives (FN)**: Number of individuals who have the disease but are incorrectly identified as not having it.\n",
    "- **True Negatives (TN)**: Number of individuals correctly identified as not having the disease.\n",
    "- **False Positives (FP)**: Individuals who do not have the disease, but the test incorrectly identifies them as having it."
