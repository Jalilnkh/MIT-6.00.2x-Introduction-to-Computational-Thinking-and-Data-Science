This exploration process continues until all the nodes in the graph have been visited.\n",

    "### Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm used to explore nodes and edges of a graph systematically. Hereâ€™s an overview of the BFS algorithm, its characteristics, and applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:\n",
    "- BFS explores a graph level by level starting from a given source node.\n",
    "- It uses a queue data structure to keep track of nodes to be explored next.\n",
    "- Nodes are visited in the order of their distance from the source node, ensuring that the shortest path (in terms of number of edges) is found first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Representation**:\n",
    "   - BFS can be applied to graphs represented as adjacency lists or adjacency matrices.\n",
    "   - It works on both directed and undirected graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Structure**:\n",
    "   - **Queue**: BFS uses a queue to manage the order of node exploration.\n",
    "   - **Visited Set/Array**: Keeps track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting and to prevent infinite loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "   - For a graph with \\( V \\) vertices and \\( E \\) edges, the time complexity is \\( O(V + E) \\).\n",
    "   - This is because each vertex and edge is processed once.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Space Complexity**:\n",
    "   - The space complexity is \\( O(V) \\), primarily due to the storage requirements of the queue and the visited set/array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Start with a queue and enqueue the source node.\n",
    "   - Mark the source node as visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Traversal**:\n",
    "   - Dequeue a node from the queue and process it.\n",
    "   - For each unvisited neighbor of the current node, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\n",
    "   - Repeat the process until the queue is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Shortest Path in Unweighted Graphs**:\n",
    "   - BFS finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in an unweighted graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Web Crawlers**:\n",
    "   - Web crawlers use BFS to explore links level by level, ensuring all pages at the current depth are explored before moving deeper.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Social Networking Sites**:\n",
    "   - To find the shortest path (degrees of separation) between two users.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Peer-to-Peer Networks**:\n",
    "   - Used to find all neighbors within a given distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Maze and Puzzle Solvers**:\n",
    "   - BFS can be used to find the shortest path through a maze.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Broadcasting in Networks**:\n",
    "   - Ensures that a message reaches all nodes in the minimum number of hops.\n"
