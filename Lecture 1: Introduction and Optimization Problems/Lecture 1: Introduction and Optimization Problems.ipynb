    "The knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem that derives its name from the scenario of a traveler trying to maximize the value of items placed in a knapsack of fixed capacity. It is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using various approaches, including dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and backtracking.\n",

    "### Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight does not exceed a given capacity and the total value is as large as possible.\n",

    "### Types of Knapsack Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **0/1 Knapsack Problem:**\n",
    "   - Each item can either be included in the knapsack or not (i.e., you cannot take a fractional part of an item).\n",
    "   - **Example:** Given items with weights and values, and a knapsack capacity, decide whether to include each item or not to maximize total value without exceeding the capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fractional Knapsack Problem:**\n",
    "   - You can take fractional parts of items.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Given items with weights and values, and a knapsack capacity, take fractions of items to maximize total value without exceeding the capacity. This problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Unbounded Knapsack Problem:**\n",
    "   - There is no limit on the number of times you can include an item.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Given items with weights and values, and a knapsack capacity, decide how many of each item to include to maximize total value without exceeding the capacity.\n",
