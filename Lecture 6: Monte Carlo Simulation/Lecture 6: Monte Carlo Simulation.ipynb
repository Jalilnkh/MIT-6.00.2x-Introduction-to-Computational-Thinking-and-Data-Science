    "In probability theory, the law of large numbers (LLN) is a mathematical theorem that states that the average of the results obtained from a large number of independent random samples converges to the true value, if it exists. More formally, the LLN states that given a sample of independent and identically distributed values, the sample mean converges to the true mean. For example, a fair coin toss is a Bernoulli trial. When a fair coin is flipped once, the theoretical probability that the outcome will be heads is equal to 1⁄2. Therefore, according to the law of large numbers, the proportion of heads in a \"large\" number of coin flips \"should be\" roughly 1⁄2. In particular, the proportion of heads after n flips will almost surely converge to 1⁄2 as n approaches infinity."

    "## Computing confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing confidence intervals is a fundamental statistical method used to estimate the range within which a population parameter lies, based on a sample statistic. Here’s a step-by-step guide to compute confidence intervals for a population mean, population proportion, and the difference between two means or proportions:\n",

    "### 1. **Confidence Interval for a Population Mean**\n",
    "To compute the confidence interval for a population mean \\(\\mu\\), you need to know:\n",

    "- The standard deviation sigma (if population standard deviation is known) or the sample standard deviation s (if population standard deviation is unknown)\n",
    "- The sample size (n)\n",
    "- The desired confidence level (e.g., 95%)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps for Calculation:\n",
    "1. **Determine the sample statistic**: This could be the sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) or sample proportion \\(\\hat{p}\\).\n",
    "2. **Select the confidence level**: Common choices are 90%, 95%, and 99%.\n",
    "3. **Find the appropriate critical value**: This could be \\(Z\\)-value for large samples (normal distribution) or \\(t\\)-value for smaller samples.\n",
    "4. **Compute the margin of error**: Use the standard error of the statistic and the critical value.\n",
    "5. **Construct the confidence interval**: Add and subtract the margin of error from the sample statistic.\n",
